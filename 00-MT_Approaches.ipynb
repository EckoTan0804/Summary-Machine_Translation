    ">  RBMT belongs to the domain of rationalism and CBMT empiricism. Given large-scale and fine-grained linguistic rules, RBMT systems are capable of producing translations with reasonable quality, but constructing the system is very time-consuming and labor-intensive because such linguistic resources need to be hand-crafted, frequently referred to as [knowledge acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_acquisition) problem. Moreover, it is of great difficulty to correct the input or add new rules to the system to generate a translation. By contrast, adding more examples to a CBMT system can improve the system since it is based on the data, though the accumulation and management of the huge bilingual data corpus can also be costly.\n",

    "#### Direct Systems (Dictionary-based translation)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Translation by **dictionary lookups**\n",
    "  -  word by word, usually without much correlation of meaning between words\n",
    "- Earliest approach to MT\n",
    "\n",
    "- Translation memory\n",
    "  - Store many translations\n",
    "  - Present **closest** match for new sentence\n",
    "  - Useful only when you expect same or similar sentence to show up again, but then high quality\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transfer-based MT / Transfrer RBMT Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "- Currently one of the most widely used methods of machine translation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Analyze into syntactic structure (i.e. parsing)\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Morphological analysis -> root form\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Dependency structure\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Transfer source language structure into target language\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Reordering, inserting and deleting\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Converting\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Also lexical transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Generate into target language\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Full word form\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Agreement: case, number, gender\n",
    "\n",
    "- Problem: Effort with Grammar Writing, Lack of Semantics\n",

    "#### Interlingua-Based MT / Interlingual RBMT Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "- Language independent structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Analyse source language into interlingua (an abstract language-independent representation)\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Generate into target language\n",
    "\n",
    "- üëç Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "  - For n languages only n analysis and n generation grammars instead of n(n-1) transfer components\n",
    "  - Translate back into source language -> paraphrase\n",
    "  - Handle ungrammatical speech\n",
    "\n",
    "- üëéDisadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Time consuming (expensive!)\n",
    "  - Representation should not contain ambiguities\n",
    "  - Realistic only for limited domains\n",

    "- Automatically align words and phrases within sentence pairs in a parallel corpus\n",
    "- Probabilities are determined automatically by training statistical models using the parallel corpus\n",
    "- Using statistical models\n",
    "  - Create many alternatives, called **hypotheses**\n",
